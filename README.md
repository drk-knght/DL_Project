# Deep Learning Assignments

## Assignment- 1 ##
1. Building deep learning models requires taking design and architectural decisions which play an essential part in the performance of the resulting model.

2. Build 36 deep learning models by taking reasonable design and architectural decisions for Fashion MNIST dataset. 

3. Consider the following hyperparameters for building these models:

	a)Activation functions: Sigmoid, Tanh, ReLU
 
 	b) Loss functions: Categorical Cross-Entropy, KL Divergence
 
	c) Number of hidden layers: 1, 2, 3, ..., 10
 
 	d) Number of nodes in hidden layer: 16, 32, 64, ..., 1024
